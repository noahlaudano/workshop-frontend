      <br />
      <p>
        These are some usefull tricks you can teach your dog in only one day of
        practice. You only need your dog and some dog treats to
        <strong>start having fun!</strong>
      </p>
      <br />
      <hr />
      <h3>Sit ‚òùüèº</h3>
      <hr />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Get your dog a treat. Let him smell it, then put it in your closed
          wrist.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place yourself in front of the dog while it is watching and waiting to
          receive the treat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Say, <em>[Name], sit down!</em> or <em>Sit!</em> Use the word you
          prefer.
        </li>
        <li>
          With the dog's attention focused on your hand, start following an
          imaginary line to the dog's back, going over the head.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h3>Stay ‚úãüèº</h3>
      <hr />
      <ul>
        <li>
          When the dog is sitting, try to be positioned close to him, on the
          left or right side (choose one side). Put on the collar and say
          <em>[Name], stay!</em> while placing your open hand next to him. Wait
          a few seconds and, if he is quiet, say again <em>Very Well</em> or
          <em>Good Boy</em>, in addition to rewarding him with a treat or
          petting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat the previous process until you can be quiet for more than ten
          seconds. Always continue to reward him at the beginning, then you can
          alternate between a reward or a simple <em>Good Boy</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you get your dog to be quiet, say the command and try to get away
          a little. If he goes after you, come back and repeat the command. Go
          back a few meters, call the dog and offer a reward.
        </li>
        <li>
          Increase the distance gradually until the dog is virtually still over
          a distance of more than 10 meters, even if someone else calls him.
          Don't forget to always call him at the end and say
          <em>Come Here</em> or something like that so he knows when to move.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h3>Shake Hands üëäüèº</h3>
      <hr />
      <ul>
        <li>
          The secret is that your dog will already naturally paw at you if they
          want something. When you present a closed fistful of treats, your dog
          will be compelled to paw at your hand since they can‚Äôt get the treats
          with their mouth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once they continue to paw, begin to use the command <em>Shake</em> and
          after repeating it several times, your dog is sure to learn a brand
          new trick. Follow the instructions in the video above for more
          details.
        </li>
      </ul>
